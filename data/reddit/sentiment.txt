comment_raw: “Do you want them to tar and feather you in the hopes they’ll forgive you for what you’ve done?”

Emily Blunt delivering the most scathing condemnation of Oppenheimer’s character and actions was so fucking powerful. Mix that in with her portrayal of postpartum depression, a mother and wife resigned to be nothing but a caretaker in the shadow of an ego driven, neurotic, anxiety filled genius and then a powerhouse fighter in the hearing, I think she was a real highlight for me. 

The film was way more humanising of Oppenheimer then I was thinking it’d be but also so much more damning of him than I’d ever thought it would be., sentiment: [{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.993239164352417}]

comment_raw: The feeling in my theater was palpable after the Trinity Test was successful and everyone on the ground was cheering its success.

Really chilling scene., sentiment: [{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9983538389205933}]
comment_raw: The biggest thing for me was, just how impactful the first explosion was to the people that were there doing the testing.

They weren’t just creating another bomb, but something terrifying, world ending stuff. 

Nolan really gets that across to the audience. Impactful stuff.

But the size of the explosion threw me off. Because you see stuff [like this](https://youtu.be/NofLHhxHwYk) and the close up shots of the buildings being destroyed, [like this](https://youtu.be/DXg2P9dx-GM).


But to realize a nuclear explosion is just [this](https://youtu.be/8PJEpeU00eU) when viewed from afar, I can now totally see the scale Nolan was going for. It never really occurred to me just how almost simple the explosion could be portrayed, I never put a lot of thought into it.

comment_raw: My brother said that Gary Oldman just needs to play Stalin now and he’ll have played all three world leaders who were at Potsdam. 

Nolan seriously pulled every string possible for casting in this. It’s amazing how he knew how all of the people he’s worked with before in their secondary roles would be able to fit together into the puzzle, but that’s part of what makes his films enjoyable. David Krumholtz’s physical transformation caught me off guard, and Rami Malek having no lines until the (verbal) bomb drops at the end was outstanding., sentiment: [{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9997348189353943}]

comment_raw: I love how Nolan played with the differences between the speed of light and sound during the Trinity Test. To convey an awe-inspiring visual spectacle only to be engulfed by the force/sound of it. 

The atomic bomb was a marvelous scientific achievement but then the magnitude of this creation and the harm it will cause literally hits you like a freight train.

comment_raw: I'm just gonna say that the bowls on the table filling up with marbles might be low-key one of my favorite plot devices. 

Most films would give some stupid exposition, try and explain something really fucking complex like bending a piece of paper and poking a hole through it or something. 

Not this film. Nolan just shows marbles filling in some bowls and keeps the film focused on what fucking matters. Brilliant., sentiment: [{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.8820264935493469}]
comment_raw: It’s funny to think that the whole barbenheimmer trend is going to convince more than one casual film goer to see a three hour dialogue heavy biopic.

comment_raw: Ends with American Prometheus realizing the full scope of what still may come to pass.

This movie was fantastic. RDJ gave one hell of a fucking performance in the final act of the movie. As did everyone, regardless of their screen time throughout. Cillian Murphy conveyed so much through his role id be surprised if he didn't win best actor. Emily Blunt gave one hell of a performance and the shot of her reliving her husband's infidelity during the clearance interview was artistically beautiful. A great "show, don't tell" moment.

The fact that the pace starts and never really never let's up, but has moments of built tension that doesn't release, and moves on to save for later, makes it feel like it also never speeds up either. Its a marathon, but its paced so well its like you were trained for that marathon. My body felt the three hour run time, but my mind didn't. 

The ending was also beautiful shot, from almost every aspect. RDJ slowly making his way towards Oppenheimer and Einstein, to the content of that teased conversation, to the way it ended., sentiment: [{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9984912872314453}]

Loved RDJ in the third act
Pacing and editing is so great.

Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt need Oscar nods IMO.

comment_raw: A film that feels like an enormous pop culture event while simultaneously being a 3 hour, dialogue heavy character study that extensively uses black and white photography. Watching such a film on a massive screen with a sold out crowd is honestly quite unbelievable. In this day in age we almost exclusively expect this for comic book movies and not much else. That thought alone genuinely brought me to the verge of tears multiple times. We just don’t get moments like this very often. Thankfully Oppenheimer is worthy of the moment., sentiment: [{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.6798367500305176}]
comment_raw: The thing that makes this movie incredible is I don't even know where to start with it. Albert Einstein is in just a few scenes and on film for what 5 minutes and the portrayal is amazing and wonderful and heartwarming. There's not a single bad performance in the movie. 

Oldman as Truman is awesome and bold because all Nolan does is portray Truman as he was. If you know history you know Truman is a good man/president and yet he comes off as a total asshole. It's remarkable. 

Downey and Murphy are 10/10. But so are so many others. Blunt is superb. Branaugh is in 2 scenes basically and he's effing incredible. 

The question of if we are doomed is so dark but powerful. And the way the movie used oppenheimer's imagination as surrealism and connects it back to him looking at art is...whew. it's just an awesome, awesome piece of art (the movie I mean). 

I'm a history teacher and I try to convey to students how big a deal the bomb is. It really is a break with the rest of our history as a species and arguably the most important thing we've ever done. It will either destroy us or send us total the stars. This movie summed up all my efforts at teaching this subject and then some., sentiment: [{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9997395873069763}]

comment_raw: Here are my main takeaways:
- There were a lot of generationally smart people on earth at the same time. Several names I recognized from textbooks that I didn’t realize knew each other and worked together. It could be because I’m not actively studying scientific journals, but it seems like we don’t have as many Einsteins, Bohrs, and Oppenheimers these days. 
- The movie had way more political undertones than I was expecting. Really highlighted that some of the madness we see in politics has existed for centuries., sentiment: [{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9947748184204102}]

comment_raw: I watched the movie, I felt like this is the best Christopher Nolan movies in years, it felt massive with so many actors in here and yet felt intimate because, this movie peeled the layer of Oppenheimer that we've never seen before on big screen, Cillian Murphy stepped in to a lead role and he executed that so precisely, RDJ also gave memorable performance as Strauss, the antagonist for Oppenheimer.

I also felt like Nolan is firing on all cylinders in here, camera works, sound designs, score, script were all top notch., sentiment: [{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9996740818023682}]
comment_raw: For a 3 hour heavy dialogue film to have this type of speed to it is incredible. Honestly it was hard to distinguish where scenes began and ended with it's editing and pacing. It just did not stop and I loved it. It cuts to a single shot for a split second, then back to the scene, then forward to another, then backwards again while in colour for a first person perspective then to a black and white objective perspective with the music swelling along while all being coherent., sentiment: [{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.99954754114151}]

comment_raw: - Arguably one of Nolan’s tightest scripts. It felt concise for what it was trying to do, and has hardly any filler scenes. 

- RDJ was incredible. I liked how he was kind of Tony Stark-ish at first, and then he becomes more and more unlikable as it goes on. He’s the front runner for Supporting Actor this year, for sure.

- Matt Damon was an unsung highlight. He was hilarious, and always gave great line deliveries.

- Gary Oldman as Truman was a great cameo. He was such a prick in only 2 minutes of screen time.

- The Trinity Test scene was absolutely breathtaking. The tension, followed by the silence, followed by the sound was thrilling to experience.

- Holy shit, that scene with Oppenheimer giving the speech in the gym and he hallucinates the bomb going off on the crowd. Genuinely one of the most haunting scenes I’ve ever seen.

- The score was fantastic, Ludwig deserves a ton of credit for building up the intensity with his score., sentiment: [{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9988436698913574}]
